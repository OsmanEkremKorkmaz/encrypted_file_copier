# File Encryption Copier

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* cryptography

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:


```
pip install cryptography
```
## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the `file_encryption.py` file.

2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the `file_encryption.py` file is located.

3. Run the following command:

```
python file_encryption.py
```
4. The script will prompt you to choose whether to use the default source and destination folders (C:/ and a flash drive user folder), or to specify your own. If you choose to use your own, you will need to enter the full file path of each folder.

5. The script will then encrypt all the files in the source folder and copy them to the destination folder. It will also create a `key.txt` file in the destination folder that contains the encryption key.

## Troubleshooting
1. Make sure that you have installed all the required libraries.

2. Make sure that you have entered the correct file paths for the source and destination folders.

3. If you encounter any other issues, please reach out to the repository owner or open an issue in the repository.
